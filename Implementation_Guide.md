## ✅ FULL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE – Step-by-Step

---

### ⚙️ **Requirements**

* Install **Python 3.x**
  You can download it from: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)

* No extra libraries are needed. Everything uses built-in modules: `time`, `random`, `hashlib`.

---

### 📂 **Project Files**

You should have these 4 files:

* `blockchain_simulation.py`
* `mining_simulation.py`
* `consensus_demo.py`
* `README.md`

---

## ▶️ HOW TO RUN EACH FILE

---

### 1️⃣ `blockchain_simulation.py`

#### 🔧 What It Does:

* Creates a **chain of 3 blocks**
* Each block contains: `index`, `timestamp`, `data`, `nonce`, `hash`, `previous_hash`
* **Tampering test**: changes Block 1 data and shows how it breaks the chain

#### 🛠️ How to Run:

```bash
python blockchain_simulation.py
```

#### 📤 Output Example:

```
=== Blockchain ===
Index: 0
Data: Genesis Block
...
Index: 2
Data: Block 2 Data
...

--- Tampering Block 1 ---

=== Modified Blockchain ===
Index: 1
Data: Tampered Data
Hash: <new hash>
...
```

#### ✅ Goal:

Understand how changing one block requires rehashing all others.

---

### 2️⃣ `mining_simulation.py`

#### 🔧 What It Does:

* Simulates **mining using Proof-of-Work**
* Finds a `nonce` so that the hash starts with `"0000"` (based on difficulty)

#### 🛠️ How to Run:

```bash
python mining_simulation.py
```

#### 📤 Output Example:

```
Mining block with difficulty 4...
✅ Block mined!
Nonce: 34291
Hash: 0000a8c8f94ab...
⏱ Time taken: 1.8721 seconds
```

#### ✅ Goal:

Feel the computational effort needed to find a valid block (hash).

---

### 3️⃣ `consensus_demo.py`

#### 🔧 What It Does:

Simulates and compares 3 blockchain consensus methods:

* **PoW** – chooses miner with most computing power
* **PoS** – chooses validator with most stake
* **DPoS** – chooses top 3 voted delegates

#### 🛠️ How to Run:

```bash
python consensus_demo.py
```

#### 📤 Output Example:

```
=== Consensus Mechanism Simulation ===

[PoW] Miners and power: {'Miner1': 68, 'Miner2': 84, 'Miner3': 45}
[PoW] Selected Validator: Miner2

[PoS] Validators and stakes: {'Validator1': 44, 'Validator2': 99, 'Validator3': 76}
[PoS] Selected Validator: Validator2

[DPoS] Votes: {'Alice': 71, 'Bob': 90, 'Charlie': 65}
[DPoS] Selected Top Delegates: ['Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie']
```

#### ✅ Goal:

Compare how different blockchain systems pick validators and who gets to create the next block.
